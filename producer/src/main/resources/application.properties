## 1. Connection Properties (Shared)
# This is typically shared with the consumer.
# If you already have this, you don't need to add it again.
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092

## 2. Producer-Specific Properties
# All producer settings go under this prefix.

# 3. Serialization
# Serializer class for keys. This tells the producer how to convert
# your Java object (e.g., a String) into raw bytes for Kafka.
spring.kafka.producer.key-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer

# Serializer class for values.
spring.kafka.producer.value-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer

## 4. Optional: Delivery Guarantees
# This controls how many brokers must confirm they received the message.
# - 'all':   Highest durability. The leader and all in-sync replicas must acknowledge. (Safest)
# - '1':     Default. Only the leader broker has to acknowledge. (Faster)
# - '0':     No acknowledgment. (Fastest, but messages can be lost)
